COOPERATIVE SOCIETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This project is designed to create a digital platform for the Joint Registrar of Cooperative Societies, Kalpetta, Wayanad, to simplify and improve the management of cooperative societies. The system will allow societies to register online, upload required documents, and receive digital certificates. It will enable real-time monitoring of society activities and compliance with government regulations.  

The platform will automate audit scheduling, track compliance, and send notifications via SMS, email, and in-app alerts about important deadlines, audits, and policy updates. It will also include tools for generating reports, dashboards, and predictive insights to help in decision-making.  

An AI-powered chatbot supporting English and Malayalam will assist users with queries related to registration, audits, and compliance. The system will provide e-learning resources and manage training programs for cooperative members and staff. Additionally, secure document management will ensure safe storage and controlled access to important files.
